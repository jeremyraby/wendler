# About

This is a collection of templates based on strength training plans in Jim Wendler's book "Beyond 5/3/1". Wendler's method includes 3 sets of "main" lifts at increasing percentages of your 1 repetition maximum weight followed by several sets of "supplemental" lifts which can be done in a plethora of formats and intensities. All of the weights prescribed by the program can be calculated months in advance with a spreadsheet and a few formulas allowing you to plan your strength training quite far into the future.

## The Templates

**First Set Last v1**

After the 3 main sets, one all out set is performed at the same weight used for the first main set.

**First Set Last v2**

Instead of a single "As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP)" set, 3-5 sets of 5-8 reps are performed with the same weight used for the first main set.

**Pyramid**

After the 3 main sets, pyramid the weights back down to the same as the first set.

**Boring But Big**

This one's a doozy wherein 5 sets of 10 reps are performed at 50% of your Training Max.

### Personal Preference

I chose to inlcude the "sister lifts", eg squat and deadlift, as the supplemental lifts for each training day. Wendler specifically recommends this for Boring But Big, but it's also acceptable to do so using other templates. This is personally less boring but also increases frequency of practicing the technique of each lift.
